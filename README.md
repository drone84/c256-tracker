The C256 Tracker is a music sequencing application written for the C256 Foenix retro computer.

Language is Assembly.
You will need the tass-64 assembler to compile this code.
Go to https://sourceforge.net/projects/tass64/ to get it.

I'm currently using version *64tass Turbo Assembler Macro V1.54.1900*

The model I'm using is RAD Tracker https://www.3eality.com/productions/reality-adlib-tracker.
The C256 Tracker is only able to play version 1.1 RAD files.

Implementing version 2.0 is left for later.

You will need the C256 Foenix IDE to code and debug: https://github.com/Trinity-11/FoenixIDE.

Finally, this code was written for Rev B of the C256 Foenix board.  It is likely that a Rev C of the board will be mass produced as well, so this program may or may not work for the new board.

Cheers!
